Concierge is a an everyday travelling companion in the form of an iOS app. It runs in the background of a user's phone and notifies them of interesting locations or points of interest nearby via a push notification.

**NOTE FOR CODE REVIEWING**: The most up to date code is currently in the branch dev-James. To view the code for the app click the folder ConciergeApp and then once again the folder ConciergeApp. There you should see all the files associated with the iOS app. The specific files to look at ViewController.swift, ViewController2.swift, and TableViewController.swift.

In order to build the project, you must have the latest version of Xcode installed on your computer (may also require upgrading to Sierra if you have an outdated macOS version).

After opening Xcode, you should be able to build and run an iPhone simulator by pressing the "Play" button on the upper left corner of Xcode.

If the app fails to build, here are a couple suggestions to fix the issue:

1) in terminal, go to the root directory and type in the command:
$ pod install

This will install the necessary dependencies used by our app. Afterwards, try building/running again.

2) You may need to register with Apple as an Apple Developer, which you can do at this link:
